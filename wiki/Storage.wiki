=_Adding a data store_=

If no _storage_ is added, the *SPADE* kernel will silently discard any provenance metadata that is sent to it. To subsequently use the information, it must be committed to persistent storage. An arbitrary number of storage subsystems can be added. The *SPADE* kernel will send the filtered, integrated provenance metadata to each of the storage classes that have been added.

*SPADE* includes support for storing provenance in the [http://neo4j.org Neo4j] graph database, the [http://www.h2database.com H2] SQL database, and in [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] format. (Support for other storage can be implemented creating a class in the `spade.storage.*` package that extends the [http://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/source/browse/trunk/SPADE/src/spade/core/AbstractStorage.java spade.core.AbstractStorage] class.)
