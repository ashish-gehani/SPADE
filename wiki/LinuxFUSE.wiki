=_Limiting filesystem provenance collection on Mac OS X_=

It may be preferable to only collect provenance about a limited part of the filesystem (that a target application is using, for example). Additionally, collecting fine-grained provenance, including I/O time, can impose significant overhead when done across the entire operating system. This reporter allows provenance collection to be limited to a subtree (/tmp/mountPoint in the example below) of the filesystem._=

===Requirements:===
 * FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
 * On Fedora, FUSE can be installed by issuing the following command:
{{{
yum install fuse fuse-devel fuse-libs
}}}

----

The LinuxFUSE reporter is built automatically with 'make' in the root SPADE directory. Before this reporter can be used, the option *user_allow_other* _must_ be enabled in the file `/etc/fuse.conf`.

----

To use this reporter, the argument must specify the path where the FUSE filesystem will be mounted:

{{{
-> add reporter LinuxFUSE /tmp/mountPoint
Adding reporter LinuxFUSE... done
}}}

Provided that no file or directory already exists at `/tmp/mountPoint`, the above line will mount the FUSE filesystem at `/tmp/mountPoint`. Any filesystem events that occur in this subtree will be monitored by SPADE and their provenance recorded.
