=_Reporting filesystem provenance on Linux_=

===Requirements:===
 * FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
 * On Fedora, FUSE can be installed by issuing the following command:
{{{
yum install fuse fuse-devel fuse-libs
}}}

----

The LinuxFUSE reporter is built automatically when the 'make build' command is issued. Before this reporter can be used, the option *user_allow_other* must be enabled in the file `/etc/fuse.conf`.

----

To use this reporter, the argument must specify the path where the FUSE filesystem will be mounted:

{{{
-> add reporter LinuxFUSE /tmp/mountPoint
Adding reporter LinuxFUSE... done
}}}

Provided that no file or directory already exists at `/tmp/mountPoint`, the above line will mount the FUSE filesystem at `/tmp/mountPoint`. Any filesystem events that occur in this subtree will be monitored by SPADE and their provenance recorded.
