Neoclipse allows users to connect to and visualize Neo4j graph databases. To begin, download Neoclipse for your OS from [https://github.com/neo4j/neoclipse/downloads here]. Ensure that you download version 1.8 of Neoclipse as it must correspond to the version on Neo4j used by SPADE.

  # Start Neoclipse.
  # In the *Connections* window, create a new connection by clicking on the *New Connection* toolbar button.
  # Enter the desired name for the database.
  # For *URI*, enter the path to the Neo4j database on your disk.
  # Click *OK* to save the connection settings.
  # In the *Connections* window, select the newly-created connection.
  # In the *Database graph* window, click on the *Start/Connect database* toolbar button. The Neo4j graph database will now appear in this window.
