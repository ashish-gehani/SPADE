=_Viewing provenance in a relational database_=

SQL Workbench/J is a free tool that can be downloaded from [http://www.sql-workbench.net/ here]. To use SQL Workbench/J for viewing H2 SQL databases generated by SPADE, perform the following steps:

*Initial setup (this only needs to be performed once):*
  # The H2 Java library is required for use with SQL Workbench/J. This will be located in the `lib` directory of your SPADE installation. If you do not have SPADE downloaded/installed, the library can be downloaded from [http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/lib/h2-1.3.169.jar here].
  # Start SQL Workbench/J.
  # Go to *File* --> *Manage Drivers*.
  # Select *H2 Database Engine* from the list.
  # For *Library*, enter the path to the H2 Java library.

*Viewing H2 SQL databases:*
  # Go to *File* --> *Connect*.
  # Select *H2 Database Engine* from the Driver list.
  # For URL, enter the path to the H2 SQL database without the extension. For example, if the database file is located at `/tmp/database.h2.db`, enter `/tmp/database` in the URL field.
  # Enter `sa` for Username.
  # Leave the password blank.
  # Click *OK* to connect to the H2 SQL database.

The *Database Explorer* tab can now be used to view/browse the data:

The *Statement* tab can be used to execute SQL statements in the database:
