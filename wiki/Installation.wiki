=_Steps to download, compile, and run SPADE_=

*SPADE* is written in Java, allowing it to be used on a wide range of platforms. The steps described assume a Linux or Mac OS X command line environment with recent versions of `make`, `svn`, `java`, `javac`, and `find` installed. On Windows, these are available with [http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin].

Since *SPADE* is under active development, the instructions below describe how to download, compile, and run the latest stable version of the code. Other versions can be used by adjusting the revision number in the `Makefile`.

Note that `->` at the beginning of a line indicates that the command is to be executed in the *SPADE* shell. Other commands are to be used in a Unix shell (such as `/bin/tcsh`).

----

Download the *SPADE* `Makefile`:

{{{
svn checkout --depth files http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}

This will create a `SPADE` directory with a `Makefile` in it.

----

Change to the new directory and download the *SPADE* kernel and its dependencies:

{{{
cd SPADE
make svn-spade
}}}

----

Compile the core *SPADE* code:

{{{
make build-spade
}}}

----

Start the *SPADE* kernel:

{{{
make start-spade
}}}

The *SPADE* shell will appear:

{{{
SPADE 2.0 Kernel

Available commands:
       add reporter|storage <class name> <initialization arguments>
       add filter <class name> <index>
       remove reporter|storage <class name>
       remove filter <index>
       list reporters|storages|filters
       query <class name> vertices <expression>
       query <class name> lineage <vertex id> <depth> ancestors|descendants <output file>
       exit

-> 
}}}

----

At the outset, no reporters, storage, or filters are present. This can be seen with the *SPADE* shell's `list` command:

{{{
-> list reporters
No reporters added

-> list storages
No storages added

-> list filters
No filters added
}}}

----

To stop *SPADE*, use the `exit` command in its shell:

{{{
->exit
Shutting down reporters... done
Flushing buffers... done
Shutting down storages... done
Terminating kernel...
}}}
