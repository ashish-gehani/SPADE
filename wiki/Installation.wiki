=_Steps to download, compile, and run SPADE_=

*SPADE* is written in Java, allowing it to be used on a wide range of platforms. The steps described assume a Linux or Mac OS X command line environment with recent versions of `make`, `svn`, `java`, `javac`, `javah`, `gcc`, and `find` installed. On Windows, these are available with [http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin].

Since *SPADE* is under active development, the instructions below describe how to download, compile, and run the latest stable version of the code. Other versions can be used by adjusting the revision number in the `Makefile`.

Note that `->` at the beginning of a line indicates that the command is to be executed in the *SPADE* shell. Other commands are to be used in a Unix shell (such as `/bin/tcsh`).

----

To compile SPADE, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required. This can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

----

Download the *SPADE* `Makefile`:

{{{
svn export --depth files http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}

This will create a `SPADE` directory with a `Makefile` in it.

----

Using terminal or shell, navigate to the new directory and download the *SPADE* sources:

{{{
cd SPADE
make download
}}}

----

Compile the *SPADE* code using:

{{{
make build
}}}

----

To start the *SPADE* server, use:

{{{
./SPADE start
}}}

----

To start the *SPADE* control shell, use:

{{{
make control
}}}

The following will appear:

{{{
SPADE 2.0 Control Client

Available commands:
       add reporter|storage <class name> <initialization arguments>
       add filter <class name> <index>
       add sketch <class name> <storage class name>
       remove reporter|storage|sketch <class name>
       remove filter <index>
       list reporters|storages|filters|sketches|all
       config load|save <filename>
       exit
       shutdown

-> 
}}}

----

At the outset, no reporters, storage, filters, or sketches are present. This can be seen with the *SPADE* control shell's `list` command:

{{{
-> list reporters
No reporters added

-> list storages
No storage added

-> list filters
No filters added

-> list sketches
No sketches added
}}}

(You will see how reporters, storages, filters, and sketches can be added in subsequent steps.)

----

To stop the *SPADE* control shell, use the `exit` command:

{{{
-> exit
}}}

----

To stop the *SPADE* server, use the `shutdown` command:

{{{
-> shutdown
}}}
