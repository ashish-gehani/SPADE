=_Collecting system-wide provenance on Linux_=

The Audit reporter is built automatically when the `make` command is issued.

Before this reporter can be used, the following commands must be executed to grant *SPADE* access to the audit stream. These commands only need to be executed once after *SPADE* is compiled:

{{{
sudo chown root lib/spadeLinuxAudit
sudo chmod ug+s lib/spadeLinuxAudit
}}}

----

To activate the transformation of the audit event stream into provenance records, the following command must be executed in the SPADE controller:

{{{
-> add reporter Audit
Adding reporter Audit... done
}}}
