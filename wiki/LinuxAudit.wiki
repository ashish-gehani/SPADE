=_Reporting operating system provenance on Linux_=

===Requirements:===
 * The Linux Audit system (http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/)
 * On Fedora, FUSE can be installed by issuing the following command:
{{{
yum install audit audit-libs
}}}

----

The LinuxAudit reporter is built automatically when the `make build` command is issued.

Before this reporter can be used, the following commands must be executed in terminal inside the SPADE directory to allow access to the audit stream:

{{{
sudo chown root build/spade/reporter/spadeLinuxAudit
sudo chmod ug+s build/spade/reporter/spadeLinuxAudit
}}}

----

The argument is unused when starting this reporter:

{{{
-> add reporter LinuxAudit
Adding reporter LinuxAudit... done
}}}
