== Packaging Instructions ==

Below are instructions for creating SPADE packages for deployment on Mac or Linux:

=== Mac OS X ===

For packaging on Mac OS X, it is assumed that you have MacPorts installed on your system. MacPorts can be found at http://www.macports.org/. The MacPort section on [http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories Local Portfile Repositories] describes the steps to set up a local portfile. For this purpose, you can download [https://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/source/browse/trunk/misc/Portfile SPADE's portfile]. Once the local port is added to the PortIndex, it becomes available for installing and packaging:

{{{
sudo port install spade
port pkg spade
}}}
