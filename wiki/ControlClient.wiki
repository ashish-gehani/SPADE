=_Starting and controlling SPADE_=

To start the SPADE server, navigate to the `SPADE` directory and use the following command:

{{{
spade-server start
}}}

This will start the SPADE server as a background process. Note that the server allows multiple startup options. To start as a foreground process, use the following:

{{{
spade-server console
}}}

SPADE can also be installed as a service to be started every time the system is booted. However, installing this service can only be done by a super-user. To install SPADE as a service, use this command:

{{{
sudo spade-server install
}}}

To uninstall the SPADE service, use:

{{{
sudo spade-server remove
}}}

To see whether SPADE is currently running or not, use the following command:

{{{
spade-server status
}}}

----

To start the controller used to configure the SPADE server, execute the following command from your terminal/shell in the `SPADE` directory:

{{{
spade-controller
}}}

The following will appear:

{{{

No sketches added
}}}

----

To exit the controller without stopping the SPADE server, use the `exit` command:

----

To stop the SPADE server completely, use the `shutdown` command:

{{{
