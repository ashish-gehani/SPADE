= Using existing tools for SQL/Neo4j databases =

This page describes some of the existing tools that can be used to view SQL and Neo4j databases generated by SPADE. *SQL Workbench/J* can be used to view SQL databases and *Neoclipse* can be used to view Neo4j databases.

=== SQL Workbench/J ===

SQL Workbench/J is a free tool that can be downloaded from [http://www.sql-workbench.net/ here]. To use SQL Workbench/J for viewing H2 SQL databases generated by SPADE, perform the following steps:

*Initial setup (this only needs to be performed once):*
  # The H2 Java library is required for use with SQL Workbench/J. This will be located in the `lib` directory of your SPADE installation. If you do not have SPADE downloaded/installed, the library can be downloaded from [http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/lib/h2-1.3.169.jar here].
  # Start SQL Workbench/J.
  # Go to File --> Manage Drivers.
  # Select "H2 Database Engine" from the list.
  # For `Library`, enter the path to the H2 Java library.
