=_Limiting provenance collection to data in part of the filesystem on Mac OS X_=

It may be preferable to only collect provenance about a limited part of the filesystem (that a target application is using, for example). Additionally, collecting fine-grained provenance, including I/O time, can impose significant overhead when done across the entire operating system. This reporter allows provenance collection to be limited to a subtree of the filesystem.

===Requirements:===
 * MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/)

----

The MacFUSE reporter is built automatically when the 'make build' command is issued.

----

To use this reporter, the argument must specify the path where the FUSE filesystem will be mounted:

{{{
-> add reporter MacFUSE /tmp/mountPoint
Adding reporter MacFUSE... done
}}}

Provided that no file or directory already exists at `/tmp/mountPoint`, the above line will mount the FUSE filesystem at `/tmp/mountPoint`. Any filesystem events that occur in this subtree will be monitored by SPADE and their provenance recorded.
