=_Reporting filesystem provenance on Mac OS X_=

===Requirements:===
 * MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/)

----

The MacFUSE reporter is built automatically when the 'make build' command is issued.

----

To use this reporter, the argument must specify the path where the FUSE filesystem will be mounted:

{{{
-> add reporter MacFUSE /tmp/mountPoint
Adding reporter MacFUSE... done
}}}

Provided that no file or directory already exists at `/tmp/mountPoint`, the above line will mount the FUSE filesystem at `/tmp/mountPoint`. Any filesystem events that occur in this subtree will be monitored by SPADE and their provenance recorded.
