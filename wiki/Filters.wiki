=_Using filters_=

We provide a set of filters to manipulate provenance data before it is committed to storage. They are described below:

----

===Fusion===

The Fusion filter can be used to merge vertices from related provenance streams. The configuration for this filter is stored in `cfg/fusion.config` and has the following format:

{{{
-- BEGIN FILE --
<1st reporter>
<2nd reporter>
<1st reporter>.<annotation>=<2nd reporter>.<annotation>
...
-- END FILE --
}}}

To merge the two streams, the names of both reporters must be specified on the first two lines of the config file.

Next, rules can be specified on which to merge annotations. These rules are specified as `<1st reporter>.<annotation>=<2nd reporter>.<annotation>`.

The Fusion filter will check to see if the merge rules satisfy the incoming vertices. If vertices are found that match the criteria, they are fused into a single vertex.

----

===IORuns===

Since reads and writes in an OS are typically chunked, a single read event to extract data from a file can result in multiple read operations happening in the underlying OS. This can result in a high volume of provenance data, especially when reading/writing large files. The IORuns filter can be used to aggregate consecutive edges of the same I/O operation (i.e., either read or write) into a single edge.

----

===CycleAvoidance===

This filter tracks the ancestors of a file and creates a new version each time a new ancestor is encountered.

----

===GraphFinesse===

This filter tracks the entire lineage graph of a file and creates a new version if a new edge would have created a cycle.
