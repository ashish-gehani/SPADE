=_Requirements for SPADE_=

*SPADE* is written in Java, allowing it to be used on a wide range of platforms. This page lists the requirements for setting up SPADE on various operating systems.

In all cases, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile SPADE. This can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

----

===Linux===

In addition to the JDK, SPADE requires that you have subversion installed on your system which is used to download the source files for compilation. You will also need [http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/ Linux Audit] and [http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ FUSE development libraries]. On Ubuntu, these can be easily installed via the following command:

{{{
sudo apt-get install subversion libaudit-dev auditd libfuse-dev fuse-utils
}}}

----

===Mac OS X===

If you are using Mac OS X, you will need subversion to download the SPADE source files. [http://fuse4x.github.com/ Fuse4X] is required to compile the Mac OS X file system reporter for SPADE. If you already have [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/ MacFUSE] installed then it is not necessary to install Fuse4X. Using [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts], you can install the required packages using the following command:

{{{
sudo port install subversion fuse4x
}}}
