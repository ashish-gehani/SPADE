=_Creating Graphviz output_=

*SPADE* includes support for the kernel to send all the provenance metadata to a single file in [http://www.graphviz.org Graphviz] _dot_ format.

In order to do this, add the Graphviz storage before sending the relevant provenance metadata to the kernel:

{{{
-> add storage Graphviz /tmp/provenance.dot
Adding storage Graphviz... done
}}}

At this point any provenance metadata that is sent to the kernel will be integrated and corresponding elements will be output to the `/tmp/provenance.dot` file. (Note that the file will be overwritten if it already existed.)

----

To stop further provenance metadata from being added to the file, the Graphviz storage can be removed:

{{{
-> remove storage Graphviz
Shutting down storage Graphviz... done
}}}

----

Assuming [http://www.graphviz.org Graphviz] is installed, the `/tmp/provenance.dot` file can be rendered with:

{{{
dot -Tsvg -o /tmp/provenance.svg /tmp/provenance.dot
}}}

----

The resulting file `/tmp/provenance.svg` can be opened with a Web browser:

{{{
firefox /tmp/provenance.svg
}}}
