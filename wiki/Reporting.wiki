=_Reporting the history of a computation_=

Provenance metadata is generated by *SPADE* _reporter_ classes. An arbitrary number of reporters can be added. The *SPADE* kernel integrates the provenance records coming from all of them.

To help a user start sending provenance information to *SPADE* with minimal effort, we have implemented a Pipe reporter. It creates a named pipe in the filesystem, to which a user can send provenance information in a simple language:

 * [Pipe Writing provenance to a pipe]

It is also possible to report provenance information through a programming interface instead of the `Pipe` reporter:

 * [ReporterAPI Programmatically reporting provenance]

Note that the `Reporter` class is loaded by and runs as part of the *SPADE* kernel. Hence implementing such a class requires handling the inter-process communication with the source from which the provenance is being collected.
