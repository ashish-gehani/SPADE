=_Collecting provenance_=

Provenance metadata is generated by SPADE _reporters_. An arbitrary number of reporters can be added. The SPADE server integrates the provenance records coming from all of them.

To help a user start sending provenance information to SPADE with minimal effort, we have implemented a `DSL` reporter. It creates a named pipe in the filesystem, to which a user can send provenance information in a simple language.

It is also possible to report provenance information through a programming interface instead of the `DSL` reporter.

We provide additional reporters for collecting operating system level or filesystem level provenance on both Mac OS X and Linux.

To learn more about these reporters, see the submenu items on the left.

Note that the `Reporter` class is loaded by and runs as part of the SPADE server. Hence implementing such a class requires handling the inter-process communication with the source from which the provenance is being collected.
