=_Using the Neo4j graph database_=

The Neo4j storage can be added to SPADE using the control client. Note that a single argument must be provided. This is the location in the filesystem where the database is to be created if it does not exist, or where it is to be retrieved from if it has previously been created. In the example below `/tmp/spade.db` is the location of the database:

{{{
-> add storage Neo4j /tmp/spade.db
Adding storage Neo4j... done
}}}

----

Storage can be added and removed while the *SPADE* kernel is running. For example, this will cause the kernel to stop sending provenance records to the Neo4j database:

{{{
-> remove storage Neo4j
Shutting down storage Neo4j... done
}}}

----

===Using the Neo4j Web interface===

Neo4j provides a Web-based administrative interface that allows users to monitor the server and browse data. When the Neo4j storage is added to *SPADE* using the `add storage` command in the control client, the Web interface becomes accessible at the URL: http://localhost:7474/.

Detailed documentation describing this web interface and how it can be used to browse data is available [http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/tools-webadmin.html here].

----

===Using Neoclipse===

The [http://neo4j.org/download_v1/ Neoclipse] tool that can be used navigate and inspect the *SPADE* Neo4j database. _Note:_ *SPADE* uses Neo4j version 1.5 and a corresponding version of Neoclipse must be used.

A database can be viewed in Neoclipse only if it is not currently being used by *SPADE*. To view a *SPADE* Neo4j database:

  # Go to Preferences (which is the first button on the top toolbar of Neoclipse on a Mac).
  # In the section "Neo4j", select the database location and exit Preferences.
  # Click on the "Start/Connect" button (which is the first button on the second toolbar of Neoclipse on a Mac).
