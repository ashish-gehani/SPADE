=_Using filters_=

===Adding filters===

SPADE supports the use of multiple filters for processing provenance metadata. A list of currently configured filters is maintained. At the outset this does not contain any filters. To add a filter, its name must be specified along with the location in the list where it should be inserted. To add a new filter and make it the first to process incoming provenance, it should be inserted into location 0. For example:

{{{
-> add filter IORuns 0
Adding filter IORuns... done
}}}

Another filter may then be added *before* the IORuns filter by also specifying 0 as the location:

{{{
-> add filter CycleAvoidance 0
Adding filter CycleAvoidance... done
}}}

At this point, CycleAvoidance is located at index 0 and IORuns is located at index 1. Another filter can be added *after* CycleAvoidance and *before* IORuns by specifying 1 as the index:

{{{
-> add filter GraphFinesse 1
Adding filter GraphFinesse... done
}}}

Based on the list maintained by SPADE, data provenance will first be transformed by CycleAvoidance, then GraphFinesse, and finally by IORuns, before being delivered to storage.

===Removing filters===

To remove a filter, simply specify the index:

{{{
-> remove filter 1
Removing filter GraphFinesse... done
}}}

----

===Listing filters===

To show the list of filters currently attached to SPADE, use the following command:

{{{
-> list filters
3 filter(s) added:
    1. CycleAvoidance
    2. IORuns
}}}
