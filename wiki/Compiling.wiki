=_Download source files and compiling_=

After fulfilling the necessary requirements for your system, the following steps are performed to download and compile SPADE.

----

===On Linux and Mac OS X===

First, use the following command to download SPADE. Ensure that you use the revision number specified in the command as the latest version of the source code may not be stable:

{{{
svn -r 660 export http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}

This will create a `SPADE` directory and download all the necessary files in it.

To compile the *SPADE* code, navigate to this newly created directory and `configure` the package before executing the `make` command as follows:

{{{
cd SPADE
./configure
make
}}}
