==Tutorial==

Since *SPADE* is under active development, it is best to use the latest version of the code. Below we describe how to download, compile, and run the latest version of the code.

*SPADE* is written in Java, allowing it to be used on a wide range of platforms. The steps described assume a Linux or Mac OS X command line environment with recent versions of `make`, `svn`, `java`, `javac`, and `find`. On Windows, these are available with [http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin].

===Getting started===

Download the *SPADE* `Makefile` with:

{{{
svn checkout --depth files http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}

This should have created a `SPADE` directory with a `Makefile` in it. You can now change to the new directory and build the *SPADE* kernel.

{{{
cd SPADE
make kernel-build
}}}

You can start the *SPADE* kernel with:

{{{
make run
}}}

At this point you will be in the shell of the *SPADE* kernel:

{{{
SPADE 2.0 Kernel

Available commands:
       add producer|storage <class name> <initialization arguments>
       add filter <class name> <index>
       remove producer|storage <class name>
       remove filter <index>
       list producers|storages|filters
       query <class name> vertices <expression>
       query <class name> lineage <vertex id> <depth> ancestors|descendants <output file>
       exit

-> 
}}}

At the outset, no producers, storage, or filters are present. You can check this with the *SPADE* shell's `list` command:

{{{
-> list producers
No producers added

-> list storages
No storages added

-> list filters
No filters added
}}}
