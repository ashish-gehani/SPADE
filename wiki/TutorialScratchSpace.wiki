==Tutorial==

Since *SPADE* is under active development, it is best to use the latest version of the code. Below we describe how to download, compile, and run the latest version of the code.

*SPADE* is written in Java, allowing it to be used on a wide range of platforms. The steps described assume a Linux or Mac OS X command line environment with recent versions of `make`, `svn`, `java`, `javac`, and `find`. On Windows, these are available with [http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin].

  * ===Getting started===

Download the *SPADE* `Makefile` with:

{{{
svn checkout --depth files http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}

This should have created a `SPADE` directory with a `Makefile` in it. You can now change to the new directory and build the *SPADE* kernel.

{{{
cd SPADE
make kernel-build
}}}
