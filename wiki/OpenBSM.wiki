----

The OpenBSM reporter is built automatically when the `make build` command is issued.

Before this reporter can be used, the following commands must be executed in terminal inside the SPADE directory to allow access to the OpenBSM audit stream:

{{{
sudo chown root build/spade/reporter/spadeOpenBSM
sudo chmod ug+s build/spade/reporter/spadeOpenBSM
}}}

----

The argument is unused when starting this reporter:

{{{
-> add reporter OpenBSM
Adding reporter OpenBSM... done
}}}
