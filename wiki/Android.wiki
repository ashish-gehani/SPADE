= SPADE for Android =

This page will guide you through setting up SPADE for use with Android.

== Requirements (Mac OS X) ==

Please ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

  * `gcc`
  * `make`
  * `subversion`
  * [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Oracle JDK]

== Setting up Android SDK ==

Download the Android SDK:

  * For Mac OS X, [http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.0.5-macosx.zip click here].
  * For Linux, [http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.0.5-linux.tgz click here].

Once the download is complete, extract the archive which will create a new directory containing the Android SDK.

== Setting up SPADE ==

First, check out SPADE by executing the following command in terminal:
{{{
svn export http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}
This command will create a new `SPADE` directory and download the required files into it.
