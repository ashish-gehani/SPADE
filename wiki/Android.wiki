= SPADE for Android =

This page will guide you through setting up SPADE for use with Android.

== Requirements (Mac OS X) ==

Please ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

  * `gcc`
  * `make`
  * `subversion`
  * [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Oracle JDK]
  * Android SDK

== Setting up Android SDK ==

Download the Android SDK:

  * For Mac OS X, [http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.0.5-macosx.zip click here].
  * For Linux, [http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.0.5-linux.tgz click here].

Once the download is complete, extract the archive which will create a new directory containing the Android SDK. For Mac OS X, this directory will be `android-sdk-macosx`. For Linux, it will be `android-sdk-linux`. In terminal, navigate to this directory and run `tools/android`:
{{{
cd ~/android-sdk-macosx
./tools/android
}}}
This will open a new window showing the list of packages available for download via the Android SDK. The necessary list of required packages should already be checked. Simply click the `Install packages..." button located near the bottom-right of the window and proceed to install these packages.

Once the installation is complete, some new directories will have been created in your Android SDK directory. These need to be added to your path. On Mac OS X, this can be done by editing the `~/.profile` file and adding the following line at the end of this file:
{{{
export PATH=/var/tmp/android-sdk/macosx/tools:/var/tmp/android-sdk/macosx/platform-tools:/var/tmp/android-sdk/macosx/build-tools/18.0.1:$PATH
}}}

Next, create an AVD for the Android emulator by executing the following command:
{{{
android create avd -n SPADE_AVD -t 15 -c 100M
}}}
This creates an AVD named `SPADE_AVD` with an SD card capacity of 100 MB.

== Setting up SPADE ==

Check out SPADE from the source code repository by executing the following command in terminal:
{{{
svn export http://data-provenance.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SPADE/
}}}
This command will create a new `SPADE` directory and download the required files into it.
