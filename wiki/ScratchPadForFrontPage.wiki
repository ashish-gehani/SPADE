Data is continuously transformed by computation. Understanding the origins of a piece of data can help in a variety of circumstances. For example, the data's history can facilitate fault analysis, decide how much the data should be trusted, or aid in profiling applications.

*SPADE* provides functionality to track and analyze the provenance of data that arises from multiple sources, distributed over the wide area, at varied levels of abstraction, and from both discrete and continuous systems. It has a number of features that make it ideal for any provenance-related needs:

==Quick Setup for Mac, Windows, and Linux==
SPADE is written in Java, allowing it to be deployed to various platforms with minimal effort. We provide pre-built packages for download, as well as the [https://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/wiki/Compiling source code for compiling from scratch].

==Ease of Use==
SPADE is designed to necessitate minimal or no changes to the workflow being monitored. Simply run SPADE with an operating system-wide or filesystem-wide reporter to [https://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/wiki/Reporting track provenance for your workflows].

==Rich Query Functionality==
Use SPADE's [https://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/wiki/QueryClient query tool] to track provenance vertices, lineage, or paths in your workflows. Alternatively, you can use [https://code.google.com/p/data-provenance/wiki/DBTools existing third-party tools] to query the provenance databases directly.
