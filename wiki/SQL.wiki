=_Storing provenance in a SQL database_=

The SQL storage can be added to SPADE using the controller. Note that four arguments must be provided when adding this storage: databases driver to use, database URL, username, and password. If either the username or password is unused, the string literal `null` should be used.

SPADE comes pre-packaged with the H2 SQL library and the following example shows how to use it to create a database in the filesystem: 

{{{
-> add storage SQL org.h2.Driver jdbc:h2:/tmp/sql/spade.sql_db sa null
Adding storage SQL... done
}}}

This will create a database in the filesystem at `/tmp/sql/spade.sql_db` if it does not exist, or use the existing database if it has previously been created.

----

The following will cause SPADE to stop sending provenance records to the SQL database:

{{{
-> remove storage SQL
Shutting down storage SQL... done
}}}
