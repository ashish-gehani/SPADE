   llvmTrace version: 2.0
**/


** SYNOPSIS:

	./llvmTrace.sh <inputFile>.bc FunctionNames <outputFile>.bc
  

** Parameters:

- inputFile: Name of the input bitcode module  (excluding the ".bc" extension)

- FunctionNames: Name of File containing the function names to monitor

- outputFile: Name of the output bitcode module (excluding the ".bc" extension)



** Internals:

- The llmvTrace.sh scripts executes as a wrapper above the LLVMTrace shared object (LLVMTrace.so) that is loaded with opt. Provided the "FunctionNames" file, a Java module implements reverse reachability analysis given the module callgraph finding the list of functions that need to be monitored. The LLVMTrace pass in turn accepts as an argument a file containing the list of functions to monitor. The bitcode output with the added instrumentation is written to the file "outputFile.bc"
